# Welcome!

Hello! I am **A F M Saif**, a Ph.D. student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). I have a background in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from BUET, where I graduated in 2018. My current research focuses on Machine Learning, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and Optimization. 

<!--I am fortunate to be guided by [Professor Tianyi Chen](https://chentianyi1991.github.io/index.html).-->
