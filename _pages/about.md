Welcome to my personal website! I am A F M Saif, and I invite you to explore my journey from my undergraduate days at Buet to my current pursuit of a Ph.D. at RPI. With a background in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Buet, I graduated in 2018 and have since embarked on an exciting academic path. My research interests now lie in the fascinating realms of Machine Learning, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and Optimization. I have the privilege of pursuing my Ph.D. at RPI with the guidance of <a href="https://chentianyi1991.github.io/index.html" target="_blank">Professor Tianyi Chen</a>. Join me as I share my experiences, insights, and discoveries in these dynamic fields. Let's embark on this intellectual adventure together.
